# Introduction
I created both songs on StableAudio.com
Links to an external site. after trying numerous AI generators. I tested almost every option on the Fairly Trained site, but only StableAudio.com
Links to an external site. worked well for me. To make the songs, I used various keywords to create a chill guitar vibe. Both are instrumental since I find AI vocals too robotic and can't sing myself, so I left out vocals. For song one, I used keywords like Post-Rock, Euphoric, and Sentimental (125 BPM). The second song features a 3/4 beat with Bright, Happy, and Surf vibes. Overall, I'm happy with the results and how natural they sound.
